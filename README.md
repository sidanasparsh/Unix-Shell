# Unix Shell

This project consists of designing a program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes command in a separate process. This project will be delivered on Linux operating system.
DELIVERABLES:
* The shell interface will give user a prompt, read the input given by the user and then execute if the command is valid. If command entered is found invalid – appropriate error will be displayed to the user.

* The user can configure the text color that is displayed on the shell interface using a pre-defined color scheme.

* Unless otherwise specified, the parent process will wait for the child to exit before continuing. However, the shell developed in the project typically also allows the child process to run in the background, or concurrently. To accomplish this, we add an ampersand (&) at the end of the command.

* The shell developed provides a history feature that allows the user to access the most recently entered commands. The user will be able to access up to 5 commands by using the feature. The commands will be consecutively numbered starting at 1, and the numbering will continue past 5.
